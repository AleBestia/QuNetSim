   components/host
   components/network
   components/protocols


Host
----

The host component is analogous to a node in a network. They are responsible for both
running applications and relaying information. In QuNetSim a host can (if desired) relay both
classical and quantum information.

Protocols
---------
The hosts in QuNetSim have certain protocols that they can execute. The protocols
are designed to perform standardized encodings so as one would expect from the transport layer.

Network
-------

The network in QuNetSim is analogous to the network in a traditional internet. The network
is responsible for maintaining information of the hosts, calculating routes, and organizing entanglement
swapping so that distant nodes share entanglement.
