Introduction
============

The goal of QuNetSim, as the name suggests, is to simulate a quantum-enabled network.
To this end, we aim to allow for the writing and testing of robust protocols for multi-hop quantum information
transmission with various network parameters, such as packet and qubit loss and random qubit errors.
We allow a developer to develop protocols for network topologies where the types of connections between
the nodes are classical, quantum, or both classically and quantumly
and we provide built in quantum network protocols for commonly used
tasks like teleportation and entanglement distribution.
QuNetSim aims to contain most of the typical features one would assume
of a quantum network such that those who are new to the field of
quantum communication can more easily experiment with quantum protocols.
