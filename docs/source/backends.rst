Backends
########

As quantum networking and quantum internet becomes a more popular field, we expect to see
a rise in the number of quantum network simulation tools as we see now with quantum computing simulation
software. In QuNetSim, we have prepared for this by structuring the network backend so that it is modular. With this,
one can simply import their own network and qubit backends, implement the necessary methods and it (*hopefully*) will work
right out of the box.

Currently we are working with two backends: `SimulaQron <http://www.simulaqron.org/>`__ and another version that has
been developed by the TQSD team.
