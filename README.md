SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

- Ensure Python3 is installed / Install Python 3 from ...
- Clone the project
- At the same level as the cloned directory, create a virtual environment with the following:

To create:

`python3 -m venv venv`

To start:

`source venv/bin/activate`

- In the cloned directory (i.e. cd QuNetSim) install the python libraries:
To install packages in requirements.txt:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

To stop the virtual environment (when not using the code) run:

`deactivate`
